Hi üëãüèº,

I'm Toni, a MSc student in High Performance Computing deeply interested in accelerating AI applications. I consider myself a high-energy individual ‚ö°Ô∏è who is passionate about learning new things. My primary focus lies in optimizing Large-Scale LLM training. I thrive on experimenting with and pushing the boundaries of new state-of-the-art technologies to achieve maximum performance, rather than just sticking to theoretical concepts. I love writing down everything I learn and sharing it with the community!

Currently I'm in Lausanne üá®üá≠ doing my Master's Thesis at the Machine Learning and Optimization Laboratory under the supervision of Professor [Mary-Anne Hartley](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=P2CPNr8AAAAJ&hl=en) and Professor [Martin Jaggi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=r1TJBr8AAAAJ&hl=en). My efforts are focused on the [Meditron project](https://www.meditron.io/), building the doctors of the future ü§ñü©∫‚õëÔ∏è! Although my main contributions are related with the the Large-Scale training of the models, I am also interested in other areas such Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and evaluation.

Passionate about cycling üöµüèº, track and field üèÉüèª, and hiking üèîÔ∏è. Don't be surprised if we ever cross paths while I'm training!
